# Voice-Controlled-Robotic-Arm-System Project
In our project, the voice-controlled robotic arm is designed to assist the medical sector by aiding doctors during operations through efficient object picking and placement.

Train
Connect your Voice Recognition V3 Module with Arduino, By Default:
connection

Download VoiceRecognitionV3 library.(download zip file or use git clone https://github.com/elechouse/VoiceRecognitionV3.git command)

When use zip format file, extract VoiceRecognitionV3.zip to Arduino Sketch\libraries folder, or if you use git clone command copy VoiceRecognitionV3 to Arduino Sketch\libraries .

Open vr_sample_train(File -> Examples -> VoiceRecognitionV3 -> vr_sample_train)

Choose right Arduino board(Tool -> Board, UNO recommended), Choose right serial port.

Click Upload button, wait until Arduino is uploaded.

Open Serial Monitor. Set baud rate 115200, set send with Newline or Both NL & CR.
